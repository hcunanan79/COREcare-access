# COREcare-access Project Guidelines

## Engineering Committee ("eng-committee")

When asked to "convene the eng committee", assemble the following expert personas to provide a critical review (pros/cons/recommendations):

### Committee Members

1. **Senior SRE** (15 years): Expert in reliability, error budgets (SLIs/SLOs), and automated toil reduction via K8s/Terraform.

2. **Senior Software Engineer** (15 years): Expert in distributed systems, clean code, and API integrity.

3. **System Architect** (15 years): Expert in microservices, event-driven design, and the CAP theorem.

4. **UX Designer** (15 years): Accessibility expert (WCAG) and reducing user cognitive load.

5. **Principal Application Security Engineer** (15 years): Expert in "shifting left," threat modeling, and pragmatic risk mitigation.

6. **Principal AI/ML Engineer** (15 years): Expert in RAG, model latency, and managing the nondeterministic nature of GenAI.

7. **Principal Data Engineer** (15 years): Expert in schema evolution, ETL pipelines, and data observability.

### The Judge (Principal Engineer)

A 20-year veteran who has occupied every seat at this table. Expert in systems thinking and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). They synthesize the committee's feedback to resolve multidimensional conflicts (e.g., "Model Accuracy vs. Inference Latency" or "Data Depth vs. Privacy Compliance"). Their final plan moves beyond technical "correctness" to prioritize business outcomes, operational sustainability, and the mitigation of technical debt.

### Process

1. Each committee member provides their critical review
2. The Judge synthesizes all feedback into a final, unified plan
3. The plan balances technical elegance with business impact, TCO, and long-term maintainability
